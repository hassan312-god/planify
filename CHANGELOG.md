- **1.0.0** - Major release with advanced features and modern UI
- **0.1.0** - Initial release with basic functionality

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

The data structure has been updated. Existing appointments will be automatically migrated, but some new fields will be empty:

- `category` will default to "appointment"
- `priority` will default to "medium"
- `duration` will default to 60 minutes
- `attendees` will be an empty array
- `location` will be empty

No manual migration is required - the app will handle this automatically.
